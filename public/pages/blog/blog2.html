    <h1>The Ever-Changing Landscape of Frontend Web Development: Insights from Job Data</h1>
    <h6>By Esteban Ramirez, 6th November 2023</h6>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      In the fast-paced world of web development, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. 
      With technology evolving at breakneck speed, developers must constantly adapt and expand 
      their skillset to remain competitive in the job market. To help you make informed 
      decisions about which web development technologies to learn, we've analyzed job data 
      from our own Job Woper website, which tracks U.S. jobs posted on the Internet. This data 
      reveals the popularity, amongst recruiters, and trends of various frontend web development 
      technologies over time.</p>

    <h2>Frontend Tech Giants: React, Angular, and Vue</h2>

      <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      According to our job data, and in line with expectations, the top three frontend 
      technologies in demand are React, Angular, and Vue (see figure 1). React leads the pack, 
      followed by Angular and Vue. This hierarchy reflects the preferences of employers and the 
      industry's focus on these frameworks.</p>

    <h2>Navigating the Impact of COVID-19</h2>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      The COVID-19 pandemic has left a significant mark on the tech job market. Initially, 
      there was a drop in job opportunities across the board (see figure 1) as most countries 
      went into lockdown and many businesses suffered. However, we then witnessed a 
      remarkable recovery, with job demand skyrocketing as most businesses also realised that
      survival would hinge on an online presence.</p> 
    <p spellcheck="true">
      But with the passing of COVID came the inevitable drop in IT jobs and so we see them
      settle back towards pre-pandemic levels. Currently we appear to be at the end of this
      drop though it's hard to foretell exactly where individual technologies will end up. In
      any case, we can see why securing a job in IT has recently become difficult. It's 
      essential for developers to consider this historical context when 
      interpreting the job market.</p>

    <h2>Trends Among Frontend Frameworks</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="../../images/blog/angular-react-vue-relative.webp">
      <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      If we aggregate all jobs posted for the top three frontend frameworks (React, Angular, 
      and Vue) and chart each as a percentage of the whole group, we can build up a relative 
      picture (see figure 2). Taking a closer look at these trends reveals interesting 
      insights. React seems 
      to be experiencing a decline in relative job opportunities, while Angular is seeing a 
      return to growth at the expense of React. On the other hand, Vue's adoption has remained 
      relatively flat. These trends could indicate a shift in the industry's priorities and 
      the need for developers to adapt their skillset accordingly.
    </p>
    <p spellcheck="true">
      Nevertheless, React continues to have a strong presence on job boards (see figure 1), with a long-term 
      positive trajectory, even if it might be slowing on relative terms. Angular, on the other 
      hand, is experiencing a decline in its long-term presence on job boards and whilst the 
      COVID-19 situation has contributed to this trend, it's unclear if this decline is
      slowing or will continue into the future.</p>

    <h2>The Losers: Redux and jQuery</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="../../images/blog/jquery-redux.webp">
      <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      What might come as a suprprise for some is that the job data suggests that Redux's 
      presence on job boards is waning, with fewer jobs requesting it. Developers should 
      consider whether it's worth investing time in learning this technology given the current 
      trends.</p>
    <p spellcheck="true">
      Not so surprising though is that jQuery, once a popular choice for web development, is 
      on a clear and consistent decline. Job data suggests that it might reach negligible 
      usage in the next three years. This underlines the importance of moving towards more 
      modern alternatives.</p>

    <h2>And The Winners: Svelte and Flutter</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="../../images/blog/svelte-flutter.webp">
      <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      Svelte, a newcomer that gained attention during the pandemic, still lags behind on job 
      boards. Although its presence has increased since 2020, it's in the process of 
      stabilizing from the initial surge in demand, making its long-term trend uncertain.</p>
    <p spellcheck="true">
      Likewise Flutter, a framework for building natively compiled applications, is on an 
      upward trajectory showing gains since 2020, in terms of job opportunities. However, it's 
      essential to note that the situation is still stabilizing after the COVID-19 drop in 
      jobs. Developers interested in mobile app development may find Flutter to be a promising 
      option.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p spellcheck="true">
      In conclusion, the web development landscape is constantly evolving, and staying 
      relevant requires monitoring job data and adapting to emerging trends. React, Angular, 
      and Vue remain strong contenders, while Svelte and Flutter show potential for the 
      future. Keep an eye on industry shifts and make informed decisions to ensure your 
      skills stay in demand.</p>
