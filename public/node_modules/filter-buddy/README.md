# Filter Buddy
Filter Buddy allows me to easily define filter options for frontend components, like tables. Three display modes allow me to display filter options as a single filter button, a set of visible filters with additional hidden, or all filters immediately visible. When a user clicks "search", Filter Buddy returns a single object with all filter values which can be passed to a backend or client-side table component.

## Minimal View
- Shows a filter button through which a user may add filters.
- Shows tags indicating which filters are currently in effect.
- Shows a search button to initiate the search process.
- When the filter button is clicked, switches to the full-size view so that users may enter filter values.

## Minimal with Default Filters
- Shows all features of the minimal view.
- Some filters can be tagged for immediate display.

## Full-Size View
- Shows every filter a user may set.
